    <p>My name is Macdennis Nwaeze, and Welcome to my portoflio!<p>
    <p> I am a passionate Wellsite Geologist and QA/QC Data Analyst with a strong background in geology and geophysics. I hold a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Geology and a Master of Science (MSc) in Geophysics, along with my Geologist in Training (GIT) certification. My work focuses on ensuring the accuracy and quality of geological data, which plays a critical role in successful drilling operations.<p>
    <p>I’m currently planning to further my education by pursuing a second Master of Science (MSc) in Geosensing Engineering, starting in the fall of 2025. This next step will allow me to deepen my expertise in advanced technologies for subsurface exploration and analysis, which I’m incredibly excited about.<p>
    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy coding, creating websites, and developing online games, which allow me to combine my technical skills with my creativity. I’m also a lifelong learner, always exploring new tools and technologies to stay ahead in my field. My goal is to continue growing, innovating, and making meaningful contributions to the geosciences industry.</p>

      <h3>Identifying mechanisms responsible for misties between the synthetic seismogram and the seismic (Delaware and Cooper basins)</h3>
      <p>This project investigates the causes of discrepancies between synthetic and real seismic data, particularly in the Delaware and Cooper Basins. The study focuses on how internal multiples, attenuation, and amplitude variation with offset (AVO) affect seismic well ties. Using theoretical models, field data, and advanced processing techniques, the research suggests methods to improve seismic image quality and well-tie accuracy. Key contributions include analyzing wavelet propagation, filtering strategies, and AVO modeling to enhance seismic interpretation and reservoir characterization.</p>

      <h3>Conversion of a field geodesy module on the neotectonics of the northern Rocky Mountains into an online exercise</h3>
      <p>The project, Conversion of a Field Geodesy Module on the Neotectonics of the Northern Rocky Mountains into an Online Exercise, was developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to transition a traditional field geodesy module into a virtual format. Utilizing remote sensing, GIS software, and geodetic data, the study focused on fault analysis, tectonic geomorphology, and seismic hazard assessment in the Northern Rocky Mountains. Key methods included surface image analysis, 3D modeling, elastic strain accumulation analysis, and fault scarp dating. The project demonstrated the advantages of virtual geologic analysis, offering a faster and more accessible approach while also highlighting limitations such as low-quality digital elevation models.</p>

      <h3>COVID-19 - The Visible Catalyst</h3>
      <p>This project examines the relationship between population density and COVID-19 transmission in Texas, leveraging GIS mapping through ArcMap to analyze infection and death rates. Given Texas’ status as the second most populous U.S. state, the study aims to illustrate how urban clustering contributes to the virus's rapid spread. The research also emphasizes the economic and social impacts of the pandemic, including rising crime rates and the necessity of stay-at-home measures. Furthermore, the project identifies optimal locations for emergency testing sites, highlighting the importance of early detection and testing in mitigating the crisis.</p>
